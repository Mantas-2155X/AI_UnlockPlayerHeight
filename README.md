# AI_UnlockPlayerHeight  
This plugin unlocks the players height hard lock of 75.  

It is *recommended*, that you keep players height during H at 75 (default) to avoid issues with H animations. 
Illusion lazy-ed out and made all H animations prefer 75 as the player height, causing some of them to look weird when the player is at different heights.  

Needs https://github.com/IllusionMods/BepisPlugins for configuration to work!

**Current Features:**  
* Align camera position with players height  
* Set player height according to card (seperate for Roam and H)  
* Set player height according to custom value (seperate for Roam and H)  
* Male height slider is now available in the charamaker  

**Download:**  
* Download the latest `AI_UnlockPlayerHeight.zip` from https://github.com/Mantas-2155X/AI_UnlockPlayerHeight/releases  

**Installation:**  
* Unzip `AI_UnlockPlayerHeight.zip` into your game directory. If done correctly, in `BepInEx/plugins/2155X/` you should see `AI_UnlockPlayerHeight.dll`  
* If you're moving from an older version (<1.1.2), make sure to remove the old file `BepInEx/plugins/AI_UnlockPlayerHeight.dll`  
**Configuration:**  
* Please look at the plugin settings menu and enable/modify which features you want.  

**To-Do:**  
* (handholding) Make players hand raise to compensate for the girl being huge and player being tiny.  
* Somehow make H animations fit better at different player heights.
